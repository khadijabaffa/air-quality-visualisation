# Air Quality Visualisation

This project was developed as part of my university coursework for the Data Analytics and Visualisation module at the University of Portsmouth. It explores air pollution trends in Portsmouth using environmental datasets from 2018 to 2023.

The app leverages **R**, **Shiny**, and **Plotly** to analyze and visualize concentrations of key pollutants such as **PM₁₀**, **Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂)**, and **Nitric Oxide**.


## Features
- Bubble charts to represent pollutant concentrations over time
- Monthly bar charts comparing average pollutant levels
- Interactive Shiny dashboard with dynamic filtering
- Built using tidyverse, lubridate, and plotly

## Getting Started

To run the app locally:

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open the project in RStudio
3. Start by running `main.R` to load and process the data
4. Then run the individual visualization scripts (e.g., `visualisation1.R`, `visualisation2.R`, etc.) to explore different aspects of the data
